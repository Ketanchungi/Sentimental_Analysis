Sentiment Analysis of Learning Management Systems on Twitter

Introduction

In the era of digital education, Learning Management Systems (LMS) have become pivotal in shaping how we learn and interact with educational content. Understanding the public sentiment towards these systems can provide invaluable insights for educators, developers, and policy-makers alike. This project aims to explore the vast terrain of public opinion on LMS by harnessing the power of sentiment analysis on data extracted from Twitter.

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive sentiment analysis of tweets related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Learning Management Systems. By tapping into the real-time public discourse on Twitter, we aim to uncover the prevailing sentiments and perceptions surrounding these educational technologies.

Methodology
The project unfolds in several structured phases:

Data Collection: Utilizing the Twitter API, we have amassed a large dataset of tweets that mention various LMS and related technologies. This dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Given the vast and often noisy nature of Twitter data, we embarked on an extensive data cleaning process. Using Python, we filtered out irrelevant information, corrected anomalies, and prepared the data for analysis. This step ensured the integrity and quality of our dataset, making it a robust base for accurate sentiment analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: We employed advanced natural language processing techniques to gauge the sentiments expressed in the tweets. Our approach distinguished between positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, providing a nuanced view of public opinion.

Visualization with Tableau: To make our findings accessible and understandable, we used Tableau to create a comprehensive dashboard. This interactive tool allows users to delve into the data and uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies in the sentiments expressed across different demographics and time frames.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Our primary language for data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and sentiment analysis.
Natural Language Processing Libraries: Utilized for parsing and interpreting the textual data from tweets.
Tableau: For creating an insightful and interactive dashboard that visualizes the sentiment trends and patterns.
Impact and Future Work
This project not only sheds light on the current state of public sentiment towards LMS but also sets the stage for future research. The methodologies and findings can guide enhancements in LMS design, policy-making, and user engagement strategies. Going forward, we plan to expand our analysis to include a broader range of sources and incorporate more sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques.

Contributions
We invite the community to contribute to this project by suggesting improvements, adding new features, or helping with future research directions. Your insights and feedback are invaluable in making this project a richer and more comprehensive resource.
